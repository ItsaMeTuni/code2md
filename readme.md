# What is code2md?

code2md is (or _will_ be) a command line tool that creates markdown pages from a generated XML documentation file. It is similar to doxygen but it also enables you to put the generated markdown files into mkdocs or other tools like that so you can have a easily customizable code reference.

# How to test it

Clone this repo, create a folder called `MD` in the project root and add a generated XML documentation file to the root of the project (the XML file has to be named "Documentation.XML").

# Why is this so bad?

Because it is a huge project in development by one single guy XD. If you want to help I'd greatly appreciate it. If you like the idea I think you're gonna have to wait a bit until you can use it...
